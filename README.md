Design and Implementation of a Smart Parking System using IoT Technology                                  

With the rapid increase in the number of vehicles in urban areas, drivers waste a lot of time and fuel  to find an appropriate parking spot in a commercial parking lot. Moreover, approximately 30% of urban congestion is created by drivers cruising for packing space.

This paper aims at providing a low cost solution to this problem by creating a Smart Parking Space using the technology of IoT and an inexpensive processor - NodeMCU. 

This amalgamation of embedded systems, connectivity and application will provide the user with the information of available parking spaces in a parking lot and also allows the user to reserve a parking space in the lot within the timestamp over the MQTT protocol. 

A Smart Parking Technology, as such, will help optimize space usage, improve the efficiency of the parking operations and help smoother flow of vehicles. 

Further, this paper proposes a completely automated and smart parking space without much human intervention by including fire alarms, temperature and humidity sensors, water sensors for avoiding waterlogging and light sensors for automatic control of lights. On the whole, this paper focuses on designing smart parking system, beneficial to both the users and provider in terms of time, fuel and infrastructure.
